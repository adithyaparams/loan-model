      <h1>Variations of Student Loans</h1>
      <p class="lead"> Explore the different types of debt to find the best composition of student loans for you. </p>
      <h3>Direct Loans</h3>
      <p>Fully titled as the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, these types of loans are utilized by about one quarter of colleges in 2008. In this program, borrowers do not have a choice of lenders and are offered Stafford, PLUS, and Consolidation loans. Funds for these loans come directly from the US Department of Education, which gets its funds in turn from the US Treasury. Congress sets the maximum interest rates on both FFEL and Direct Loan programs, and while the rates on Stafford Loans are identical, the rate for PLUS loans is higher in the FFEL. Plus loans are much easier to be gain approval for in the Direct Loan program. While FFEL and Direct Loan programs both offer standard repayment, extended repayment and graduated repayment, income-contingent repayment is only in the Direct Loan program.</p>
      <h3>Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL)</h3>
      <p>Also known as the federally-guaranteed student loan program, the FFEL program is used by about three quarters of colleges in 2008, some of which were also direct loan colleges as well. In this program, borrowers have a choice of lenders and are offered Stafford, PLUS, and Consolidation loans. The funding for these loans comes from banks and other financial institutions. Many FFEL program lenders have stopped offering consolidation loans due to a lack of profitability. Congress sets the maximum interest rates on both FFEL and Direct Loan programs, and while the rates on Stafford Loans are identical, the rate for PLUS loans is higher in the FFEL. While FFEL and Direct Loan programs both offer standard repayment, extended repayment and graduated repayment, income-sensitive repayment is only in the Direct Loan program.</p>
      <h3>Stafford Subsidized Loans</h3>
      <p>Money for these loans comes directly from the federal government in a program called the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. Subsidized loans are reserved for students who can demonstrate a financial hardship, which is defined as family annual income less than about $50,000. If you have a subsidized Stafford loan, you are not responsible for making any payments until after you graduate. Interest rates typically are 3.76%, in reference to the 2017-2018 school year. The government pays your interest for you during your time in collegiate education. However, you cannot accrue more than $23,000 in subsidized Stafford Loans throughout your undergraduate studies.</p>
      <h3>Stafford Unsubsidized Loans</h3>
      <p>Money for these loans comes directly from the federal government in a program called the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. All students are eligible for this type of Stafford loan. If you have an unsubsidized loan, you are fully responsible for paying off all the interest accrued on the loan. In 2017, interest rates were fixed at 3.76% during the time the student is still studying in school, but payments are typically deferred — or postponed — until after you graduate. Your annual Stafford Loan limit for unsubsidized loans ranges from $5,500 to $12,500, depending on your year in school and whether you are claimed as a dependent on someone’s tax return. You are eligible for a larger loan if you are financially independent.</p>
      <h3>Grad PLUS Loans</h3>
      <p>These loans are for graduate and professional students themselves. PLUS loans are funded directly by the federal government, specifically the US Department of Education. However, the major difference between PLUS loans and other traditional types is that they have no maximum amounts and can be used to cover any education costs not covered by other types financial aid. PLUS loans have a fixed interest rate of 6.31% (2017). The borrower must not have an adverse credit history, and a credit check will be conducted. Although the regulations are strict, you may still have the opportunity to acquire a PLUS loan if you meet additional requirements.</p>
      <h3>Parent PLUS Loans</h3>
      <p>These loans are for parents of dependent undergraduate students who are enrolled in school at least half time. PLUS loans are funded directly by the federal government, specifically the US Department of Education. However, the major difference between PLUS loans and other traditional types is that they have no maximum amounts and can be used to cover any education costs not covered by other types financial aid. PLUS loans have a fixed interest rate of 6.31% (2017). The borrower must not have an adverse credit history, and a credit check will be conducted. Although the regulations are strict, you may still have the opportunity to acquire a PLUS loan if you meet additional requirements.</p>
      <h3>Perkins Loans</h3>
      <p>This type of loan was extremely popular with need-based college students prior to recent legislations bringing it to an abrupt end on September 30, 2017. Unless a Perkins disbursement had been received prior for the 2017-2018 academic year, the loan program effectively shut down that day. Perkins Loans used to be more desirable than Stafford Loans because they were subsidized and had a 5% fixed interest rate. Other advantages of the Perkins loan included a longer grace period of nine months before repayment began and special loan forgiveness provisions. Because of their favorable terms, Perkins Loans were only reserved for students that demonstrated exceptional financial need. Loans of this variety were granted by a college and not all schools participated.</p>
      <h3>Consolidation Loans</h3>
      <p>While most students receive loans from different borrowers annually/per semester, the repayment process can be simplified by applying for a Direct Consolidation Loan. These loans are made in a way so that you make one payment per month to only one servicer. The loan is a fixed-interest loan with rather flexible options that are all dependent on your ability to repay. There is no consolidation fee, although it can only be done once, potentially lowering your monthly payments and also could extending the amount of time needed to pay off the loan. These loans aid in reducing late fees as well. The downside is that, depending on which Direct Consolidation Loan program you choose, your payments can be stretched over a longer period of time, thus forcing you to pay more interest on debt. Additionally, you could lose some of the benefits offered by the original loan such as eligibility for loan forgiveness programs and interest rate discounts. Private student loans are not eligible for the Direct Consolidation Loan program.</p>
      <h1>Variations of Repayment Plans</h1>
      <p class="lead"> Explore the different types of repayment plans to find the best option for you. </p>
      <h3>Standard</h3>
      <p>The standard plan is the most basic plan possible. It can be used for almost any type of public loan. The payments for this type of loan are fixed, guaranteeing the loan be paid off after 10 years. Anyone can be eligible for this plan, and it is usually the lowest cost repayment plan.</p>
      <h3>Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan</h3>
      <p>Income-Based Repayment plans are an option regardless of when you received your loans and are often utilized for their flexibility. To qualify, your prospective payments must be lower than they’d be on the Standard Repayment Plan and you must demonstrate financial need. Eligible loans include Direct Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized), Direct PLUS and Consolidation Loans, Federal Stafford Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized), as well as FFEL PLUS and Consolidation Loans. Payments are usually within 10-15% of discretionary income and are held for a term of about 20-25 years. IBR plans can lower monthly payments and make you eligible for forgiveness after the repayment period, although they put you at risk to pay more through interest over time. </p>
      <h3>Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan</h3>
      <p>Income-Contingent Repayment plans, like REPAYE, do not have an income eligibility requirement. It is the only income-driven repayment plan under which Parent PLUS Loans qualify after you consolidate them into a Direct Loan. Eligible Loans are only Direct Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized) and Direct PLUS and Consolidation Loans. Under ICR, monthly payments are dependent on your income and family size and may even be higher than the Standard Repayment Plan. Payment amounts for these plans are the lesser amount of two options: 20% of your discretionary income or the payment amount on a 12-year fixed repayment plan, adjusted for income. These plans have a repayment period of precisely 25 years. </p>
      <h3>Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Plan</h3>
      <p>Pay As You Earn plans are one of the newest available in the market, similar to IBR but using stricter requirements. To take advantage of PAYE, your prospective payments must be smaller than they’d be on the Standard Repayment Plan. Eligible Loans are only Direct Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized) and Direct PLUS and Consolidation Loans. Payment amounts for these plans are generally 10% of your discretionary income lasting for a repayment period of 20 years. PAYE plans offer the lowest payment amount for all eligible borrowers and are eligible for loan forgiveness after 20 years. </p>
      <h3>Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) Plan</h3>
      <p>Revised Pay As You Earn plans became available in December, 2015. While similar to PAYE plans, the most notable differences are that you do not have to demonstrate financial need to be eligible for the plans and that you are eligible regardless of when you took out your first student loan. Eligible Loans are only Direct Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized) and Direct PLUS and Consolidation Loans. Payment amounts for these plans are generally 10% of your discretionary income lasting for a repayment period of 20-25 years.  It’s a 20-year term if all your loans under the plan were for undergraduate study and a 25-year term if any of your loans were for graduate or professional study. </p>
      <h1>Private Loan Providers</h1>
      <p class="lead"> Learn about the variety of private loan providers to discover the best option for you. </p>
      <h3>Credible</h3>
      <p>Credible is not actually a direct student lender, but instead it compiles data from 9 major private lenders and shows you the best rate for your situation. The 9 lenders that Credible considers are Citizens Bank, College Ave, Discover Student Loans, EDvestinU, iHELP, INvestED, Raise private student loans, Sallie Mae, and SunTrust. Through Credible, you can view the information provided by all 9 of these lenders all in one interface for easy comparison. This way, you can choose the loan with the best terms to suit your needs, whether you want low interest rates or a flexible repayment schedule.</h3>
      <h3>Sallie Mae</h3>
      <p>Sallie Mae is the biggest student lender on the market. It offers both undergraduate and graduate school loans, and provides the option for variable or fixed interest rates. Due to the size of the company, they have the greatest flexibility of any student lender. They can loan to students or parents, and they charge no origination fees or prepayment penalties. Their variable interest rates range from 4.37 to 11.23 percent and their fixed interest rates range from 5.74 to 11.85 percent. The three repayment plans they offer are deferred repayment, where you don’t pay at all while in college; fixed repayment, where you pay $25 every month while in college; and interest repayment, where you pay the monthly interest on the loan while in college.</h3>
      <h3>College Ave</h3>
      <p>College Ave is very similar to Sallie Mae, but they offer slightly more flexibility for repayment. Like Sallie Mae, they also offer loans for undergraduate students, graduate students, or parents. They have no early payoff fees, which means you can be as aggressive as you want with your loan payments. Their repayment plans last 5, 8, 10, or 15 years, at the borrower’s discretion. Their forbearance options are determined on a case by case basis, which means if you can’t pay for a short time, you have a good chance to be granted forbearance. College Ave’s current interest rates are 3.94 to 11.19 percent for variable rates and 5.29 to 12.78 percent for fixed rates.</h3>
      <h3>Citizens Bank</h3>
      <p>Citizens Bank is a newer entrant to the student loan market. They offer competitive rates, low fees, and a wide range of options, often considered a top option for taking loans from a major bank. These student loans are issued in 5 to 15-year terms to students or parents. However, these plans take a while to qualify for a cosigner release, specifically 36 on-time payments. Fixed interest rates vary from 6.45 to 12.05 percent and variable rates go from 6.42 to 12.02 percent APR. As with most student lenders, a .25 percent rate discount is available if automatic payments are made. There are no origination fees or prepayment fees of any type. </h3>
      <h3>CommonBond</h3>
      <p>CommonBond, unlike other student lenders who only aim to maximize profit, do a lot of social good as well through their partnership with nonprofit Pencils of Promise. They also offer a program for businesses to offer student loan assistance as a means of employee benefit. There are four repayment options that either start in-school or after graduation. The biggest downside is the two percent origination fee, but past that there are no prepayment fees and the rates are competitive. Loans are available for all types of students and parents. Interest rates range from 3.95-9.81 percent APR with 5 to 15 year payback periods. Despite origination fees, the lower interest rates make CommonBond loans often cheaper. </h3>
